## Questions & Things to Ponder

How might we design paging so that it's clear when one is moving through pages where one is at (which page of results) and how to get to end, beginning, etc?

How might we design / implement page heading updates vis-a-vis different top-level categories, searches, paging, and so on?

If we're not displaying all an items info on the front page, what "should" be on the front page? In other words, what info "should" be on the card?

Bryan's planning doc mentions "broad categories" and "parked categories" and the prototype libguide has the broad categories setting the top-level navigation. But what are the "parked" categories. In the preliminary meeting people mentioned wanting to tag items. Are the "parked categories" the tags?

Regarding categories, tags, formats: Does Bryan have a seed list for default items he'd like us to add? Of course we'll need the broad/top-level categories, but are there others we might add as defaults for him?

How definitive is the current list of top-level categories? Will there be sub categories?

Do we need tags?

Are there other fields that Bryan might want that wouldn't fit into the general "content area" for the full resource description that might need formatted text, more than just a text field that strips out HTML, etc?

Regarding the submission form in the document, it asks for a some things that aren't part of the prototype libguide display or recorded in other areas of the document for prelimiary items. Do we need that or is that just informational for Bryan?

Does Bryan want a default image set for things if he doesn't supply one? does he have specific images we'd want to add to our theme content so that we can always get to it?

What about the ScholarWorks feed in the libguide? Do we want to include that in the site somehow? It doesn't seem easily to fit into the general parameters of the request. Perhaps another top-level tab? Leave it off? A link somewhere else?

Thoughts on the footer: Does Bryan want specific things in the site footer?
